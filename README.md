# Dengue PAHO Data

This repository is for the personal exploration of Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) data on dengue in the Americas.

The data files were manually extracted from the [PAHO data portal](http://www.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/indicadores-dengue-en.html) for nationally reported dengue.
